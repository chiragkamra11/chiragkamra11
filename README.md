### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**chiragkamra11/chiragkamra11** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Chirag Kamra and welcome to my profile! I am an aspiring data scientist and on this platform, I will be sharing projects that I have worked on in analyzing datasets from various business sectors of the world, building predictive models, and solving business problems. The repositories below have been split by industries and I will be adding projects weekly as I improve the diversity of my analytics reportoire.

Here are a few details about me:

- Who am I? âš¡ I've lived in 7 different cities before Toronto and because of that, it's hard to really fixate on what I can call home. I am a civil engineering graduate with professional experience as a data analyst in an IT services firm and as a project manager in a sports management startup.  

- What I am currently doing? ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on niche techniques to improve ensemble learning model performances. Also, soft-skills wise, I am working on efficiently explaining model outputs to non-technical audiences. 

- ğŸ“« How to reach me?: chiragkamra11@gmail.com

- Hobbies: Data, Drums, Chess, Raptors and Liverpool FC.
